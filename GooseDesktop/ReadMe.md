Credit to [Samperson](https://twitter.com/samnchiet) for the [Desktop Goose](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose) and [Jakoby](https://twitter.com/I_Am_Jakoby) for the original payload. I;ve modified it for my own use.
This downloads the temp directory, extracts it to a folder called gd, and runs the main.ps1 file within the gd folder. Be sure to edit the .ps1 file with the URI to the .zip file

The FlipperGoose.txt is the same but built for the [FlipperZero](https://flipperzero.one/) device.

This payload will automatically end after 2 min 

Or if you press `Left Control` + `Right Control` at the same time
